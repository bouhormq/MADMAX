â€¢ The competition consists of designing an algorithm for a game of four players. Each player commands a group of cars on the dangerous roads of Wasteland. The goal is to get the highest possible score by collecting water bonuses and killing other player's cars. However, gas bonuses also have to be collected to keep the cars running and tires should be avoided to prevent collisions.
